# toponomastics
A script to research geographic data for the study of names

visor_toponomastics.R 
visotr_toponomastics.R is an initial script for exploratory analysis. It allows searches of place-names for a given dataset (specifications in the script comments) and gives examples of searches, lists and maps. However all the processes and more are contained in the most recent visor_toponmastics_functions.R which improves the code (with specific functions) and all the aspects data processing. Although deprecated, it is left here because it has examples of how to perform searchs and create maps for more specific local areas.

visor_toponomastics_functions.R
Updates visotr_toponomastics.R. Data is now automatically downloaded (requires web access) for the given example. Code is now easier to follow as repetitive processes are now functions.
